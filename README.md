# SweetLand
SweetLand is a fully functional project that I created for my Web Database Development class at Columbus State Community College.
The technologies used to build this web application are PHP, MySQL, SASS, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## Functionality 

There are two sides of this project: an user with account or without an account. When a potential client visits the site first time they see the content from the image bellow which represents the home page.

From home page, the user can navigate to pages like Menu, Contact, and Shopping Cart.

When an user without an account want to place an order, the application give the option to add items to the cart but to finalize the order an user is required to sign in or to create an account.
